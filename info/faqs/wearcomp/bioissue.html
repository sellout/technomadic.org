  <DT><a name="dtdhyebsc">Does the display hurt your eyes, being so close?</a> [Mann|MIT]</DT>
  <DD>The displays can actually be very comfortable to use for extended
durations.  The virtual image of the display is quite far away, and in
fact, if it is adjusted so that parallel rays of light enter the eye, then one
experiences light equivalent to an infinitely large image, infinitely
far away.  The focus can be adjusted from 10" to infinity, allowing
almost ideal viewing focus.  No vision problems have been noticed
after five years of heavy use.  Eye damage from excessively bright
light, over extended time periods, is however still a possibility, but
dark glasses can help to minimize the quantity of light needed to
balance with the ambient light.</DD>

  <DT><a name="dtvotpga">Does the vibration of the PE (one of the HMDs) get annoying?</a> [MIT]</DT>
  <DD>After wearing the PE for a few hours, the noise and vibration
really isn't noticed.  It's equivalent to the hum of most computer
monitors and the fan noise - you stop being aware of them after a
while.</DD>

  <DT><a name="cilaalww">Can I lead an active lifestyle while wired?</a> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>Early systems of the 1970s were quite cumbersome and delicate.
Although they were sometimes worn while playing road hockey, or the
like, they were delicate and not suitable for rough sports.
Durability and unrestrictiveness have been partly addressed but truly
durable construction still remains as a challenge.</DD>

  <DT><a name="cyatwwoj">Can you actually type while walking or jogging?</a> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>Yes, with a properly designed keyboard, you can type while
walking around, jogging, running, or doing other activities.  Typical wearcomp
keyboards are held in one hand and are easy to use, leaving the other
hand free.<DD>

  <DT><a name="dtcghwyawi">Doesn't the computer get hot while you are wearing it?</a> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>One thing that comes to mind, that might not at first be
obvious, is that one adapts to the heat produced by the apparatus.
After several years, the body's metabolism slows down, and resting
heart rate is much lower.  This condition is similar to someone who
has an "athletic heart", or someone who comes from a warm climate in
which the blood has "thinned".  Normally the body operates
inefficiently, but with the device on, producing waste heat, the body
reduces its heat dissipation.  The only way for the body to reduce its
production of waste heat is to become more efficient, or "athletic".
Thus even when one does not engage in a great deal of physical
activity, one becomes more similar to an athlete in one's body efficiency.
    <P>A related side-effect of wearing the apparatus for many years
is that one becomes unable to tolerate cold when removing the device,
and tends to need to wear heavy clothing in place of the device, even
when it is not extremely cold.  On very cold winter days, the
difference is not so noticable (e.g. since it is additive not
multiplicative), but the difference between a "cyborg" who has taken
off the machine, and someone who doesn't normally wear the machine, is
most evident in the summer time, where the cyborg will be found
wearing long-sleeved shirts.  Also the difference between the cyborg
and the non-cyborg is not so evident during physical activity as it is
during sleeping.  The cyborg who has stripped off the machine will
need more blankets than the non-cyborg during sleeping, but during
active moments, the two will be approximately the same (except perhaps
the cyborg who has recently removed the apparatus will be better able
to run farther on a hot day).</P></DD>
