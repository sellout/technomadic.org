      <DT>text</DT>
      <DD>The standard text input device is the Twiddler (<A
HREF="http://www.handykey.com/">http://www.handykey.com/</A>), a
one-handed, chorded keyboard and mouse combination. It allows fairly
rapid typing (up to 60 words a minute) in any body position.  You may
also want to buy a BAT keyboard (<A HREF="http://www.infogrip.com/Options.007.html">http://www.infogrip.com/Options.007.html</A>), to which you
can connect microswitches, so that you will be able to plug directly
into the keyboard port.  You can sometimes negotiate a good deal on a
bare board (e.g. without the housing) from <A
HREF="http://www.infogrip.com/">Infogrip</A>.
        <P>If you're going on the cheap, use a collection of
pushbutton microswitches.  These switches can be found in many old
appliances or equipment, and are often driven by camshafts.  Collect
as many as you can, and try to arrange them in order of stiffness, so
that the baby finger pushes the most gentle one, while the stiffest is
at the thumb position.  See <A
HREF="http://wearcomp.org/ieeecomputer.html">http://wearcomp.org/ieeecomputer.html</A>
for pictures of this kind of keyboard.</P></DD>
      <DT>video</DT>
      <DD>Video input has been accomplished through a wide range of
video capture devices. For still images, the Color QuickCam (<A
HREF="http://www.connectix.com/html/hardware.html">http://www.connectix.com/html/hardware.html</A>)
has been used with a great deal of success. It also works well for low
frame-rate movies.</DD>
      <DT>audio</DT>
      <DD>Multiple types of microphones have been used for both speech
and musical input.</DD>
      <DT>other</DT>
      <DD>A very diverse set of input devices have been attached to the
wearables: GPS locators, Affective sensors (blood pressure, GSR, heart beat,
EMG), infrared positional beacons and probes, digital cellular modems,
PalmPilots (<A
HREF="http://palmpilot.3com.com/">http://palmpilot.3com.com/</A>) and
other PDAs, etc.</DD>

  <DT>display</DT>

  <DD>The Private Eye, made by Reflection Technology, is our
primary display, able to handle 720x280 monochrome video.
Unfortunately, this display has been discontinued and a myriad of
others have fallen short of its quality.  <A
HREF="http://www.circellar.com/">Circuit Cellar</A> (June 1998)
describes how you can build a cheap display from a viewfinder salvaged
from a broken video camera.  You can also check out <A

  <DD>We have a SoundBlaster compatible PC104 board , and a variety
of speakers.</DD>

  <DD>Tons of other output devices are being played with:

<DT><A NAME="wscisawaau">What speed computer is it, and what
accessories are used?</A> [MIT]</DT>

<DD>Currently, the systems in use range from 486dx50's to Pentium
133s.  The next generation that is being tested uses a Pentium 166
processor.  The accessories most commonly used are the Sierra modem,
GPS sensor, and video or audio IO.</DD>

<!--==========-->

<DT><A NAME="hmhdsiitt">How much hard drive space is in those
things?</A> [Mann]</DT>

<DD>The basic systems generally have at least 1GB.  Some, like Steve
Mann's WearCam have as much as 6GB (two 3GB drives).</DD>

<!--==========-->

<DT><A NAME="wosau">What operating systems are used?</A> [MIT]</DT>

<DD>For a research and development environment, <A
HREF="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</A> was a natural choice that would
take full use of system resources. Not only is it efficient and
flexible,but the source is available and well supported.

<P><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</A> has a wearable computer running <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Windows 95 or NT</A> and there are
also a number of people using other free OSes such as <A
HREF="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>.  To decide for yourself, visit
<EM>Choosing An OS</EM> (<A
HREF="http://www-white.media.mit.edu/vismod/demos/speechcom/winwear.html">http://www-white.media.mit.edu/vismod/demos/speechcom/winwear.html</A>)
or <EM>OS Philosophy</EM> (<A
HREF="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/os-philosophy.html">http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/os-philosophy.html</A>).
Both pages are specific to wearables.</P><DD>

<DT><A NAME="wpaadyr">What programs and applications do you run?</A>
[Mann]</DT>

<DD>Most of the GNU freeware, such as GIMP (Gnu Image Manipulation
Program), XV, emacs, etc., as well as various calendar and planning
programs.  The reason for using GNU/Linux is to have an open
environment.  If you've ever tried to do something as simple as
getting Win95 or NT to operate over an ascii text teletype interface,
you can understand the need for getting outside the box.  Thinking
outside the box is possible when the box is not welded shut.  Linux is
reconfigurable and extensible.</DD>

<!--==========-->

<DT><A NAME="wiufn">What is used for networking?</A> [Mann]</DT>

<DD>It is strongly recommended that one take the Amateur Radio
operator's license, but if one is dead-set against this, one may also
use cellular CDPD, but the result is a very slow and unreliable
system.  CDPD is an afterthought to the telephone system.  That may
change in years to come, but the process is much slower than claimed.
Another alternative (depending on where you are located) is a
Richochet modem.</DD>

<!--==========-->

<DT><A NAME="hcibmowc">How can I build my own wearable computer?</A>
[Mann|MIT]</DT>

<DD>There are two approaches, one is to "hack" a laptop computer, and
the other is to build the wearcomp from scratch.  Full specs for the
latter are on the MIT Media Lab Web page at: <A
HREF="http://wearables.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/">http://wearables.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/</A>.
Another version can be found in the June 1998 issue of Circuit
Cellar.  The article is archived on Steve Mann's site (<A HREF="http://wearcomp.org/wearhow/index.html">http://wearcomp.org/wearhow/index.html</A>).</DD>

<!--==========-->

<DT><A NAME="hmdictb">How much does it cost to build?</A> [MIT]</DT>

<DD>Prices tend to be in the thousands of dollars, whether you buy or
build.  An alternative approach is to assemble a low cost system.  For
example, you can obtain an older computer that has NTSC output and
connect it to a small cathode ray tube from a camera viewfinder.  Be
careful of the high voltages of course: 5000 volts or 6000 volts is
common in small camera viewfinders.  Some such complete wearable
computer systems have been built for as little as $20.</DD>
