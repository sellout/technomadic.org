  <DT><A NAME="wiawca">What is a wearable computer, anyway?</A> [Mann|MIT]</DT>
  <DD>Wearable computing facilitates a new form of human-computer
interaction based on a small body-worn computer system that is always
on and always ready and accessible.  In this regard, the new
computational framework differs from that of hand held devices, laptop
computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs).  The "always ready"
capability leads to a new form of synergy between human and computer,
characterized by long-term adaptation through constancy of
user interface.
    <P>There are five major characteristics of wearable computers:</P>
    <DL>
      <DT>portable while operational</DT>
      <DD>The most distinguishing feature of a wearable is that it can
be used while walking or otherwise moving around.  This distinguishes
wearables from both desktop and laptop computers.</DD>
      <DT>hands-free use</DT>
      <DD>Military and industrial applications for wearables
especially emphasize their hands-free aspect, and concentrate on
speech input and heads-up display or voice output. Other wearables
might also use chording keyboards, dials, and joysticks to minimize
the tying up of a user's hands.</DD>
      <DT>sensors</DT>
      <DD>In addition to user-inputs, a wearable should have sensors
for the physical environment.  Such sensors might include wireless
communications, GPS, cameras, or microphones.</DD>
      <DT>"attention-getting"</DT>
      <DD>A wearable should be able to convey information to its user
even when not actively being used.  For example, if your computer
wants to let you know you have new email and who it's from, it should
be able to communicate this information to you immediately.</DD>
      <DT>always on</DT>
      <DD>By default a wearable is always on and working, sensing, and
acting.  This is opposed to the normal use of pen-based "Personal
Digital Assistants," which normally sit in one's pocket and are only
woken up when a task needs to be done.</DD>

  <DT><A NAME="wdpuslt">Why do people use something like that?</A> [Mann|MIT]</DT>
  <DD>The idea is to be "always ready", for example, you might look up
the definition of "wearable computer" in the encyclopedia, or you
might interact with people through the medium, while doing other
things.  You might also constantly grab images into a circular buffer,
and then retroactively record something.  In this way, you're always
ready, and seldom miss a good shot.  Many of the defining features of
wearables are the rationale behind wanting to wear them full time:
    <P>The HMD allows you to look at the screen and also at something
in the real world. This allows you to take notes while looking at the
professor, rather than constantly glancing back and forth between
paper and blackboard. You can be reading email and still be able to
walk down the street without running into people.</P>
    <P>Having the wearable with you is equivalent to carrying an
entire reference library with instant access. Webster's dictionary and
thesaurus are always useful to have, as well as maps and phone
books. With the jump to 5 gig drives, it would be trivial to put
Compton's encyclopedia onto the wearable and have real-time access to
a tremendous wealth of information.</P>
    <P>All the notes you ever take -- from trips, classes, business
meetings -- are always with you. With a fast search engine, you can
pull up needed information in seconds, rather than flipping through
dusty notebooks stored in your attic.  You will never have to go
hunting for a pen or piece of paper again, and never worry about
searching for that missing napkin with the new system design scrawled
on it.</P>
    <P>In a manner similar to the development of multimedia PCs, all
consumer electronics -- Music CD players, fax machines, pagers, audio
journals -- will be integrated into the wearable design. One device
will be able to handle all forms of electronic media, whether it be
audio, visual, or wireless digital communication.</P>
    <P>A seldom realized aspect of wearable computing is augmented
reality: the seamless integration of real and virtual
worlds. Electronically stored information is extremely useful when
overlayed over a view of the outside world. For example: captions
displayed with museum exhibits, names over faces (via face
recognition), wiring schematics associated with the current
project.</P></DD>

  <DT><A NAME="wiiufn">What is it used for normally?</A> [MIT]</DT>
  <DD>Most of the time spent using the wearable is found inside a text
editor -- normally emacs. Phone numbers, schedules, class notes, and
programs all can be modified or searched. With Internet access,
communication becomes very easy -- everything from real-time messaging
to full Web access using Netscape is commonplace.
    <P>Outside of this, the wearable is used just like your normal
(multimedia) desktop computer.  In some cases, the wearable is used
instead of having a 'main' computer.</P></DD>

  <DT><A NAME="hoitcw">How often is the computer worn?</A> [MIT]</DT>
  <DD>Most people with functional systems wear it about 16 hours a
day, seven days a week. Basically, all the time except during sports,
showers, sleep, and other such activities.</DD>

  <DT><A NAME="ctcbwitsows">Can the computer be worn in the shower or
while sleeping?</A> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>Most of the time one wears the system during most of the waking
hours.  Sometimes it is worn during sleeping, especially "crashing"
somewhere in which there is not a suitable place to undress or change
clothes.  Ironically, one often becomes so accustomed to the hard disk
activity that one will wake up from a deep sleep if there is something
wrong with the system (e.g. power failure or total inactivity of the
hard drive).  Current systems are not waterproof and must be removed
prior to showering.  As mentioned above, with respect to the sports
test and the swim test, there are obvious limitations that make it
impossible to wear it all the time. Nevertheless, it is often worn so
much that it becomes inextricably intertwined to the wearer.</DD>

  <DT><A NAME="wcibu">Where can it be used?</A> [MIT]</DT>
  <DD>Since one of the defining features of wearable computers is
their portability, wearables can be used anywhere a person can work
comfortably.  With 8-10 hour battery life and digital cellular modems
providing internet access, working on a wearable allows the same level
of productivity just about anywhere as a conventional desktop stuck in
an office.</DD>

  <DT><A NAME="hlhtsba">How long have these systems been around?</A>
[Mann]</DT>
  <DD>The systems have evolved over a number of years, early versions
in the 1970s gave way to more sleek and slender systems in the 1980s,
so it's been evolving, for more than 20 years.</DD>

  <DT><A NAME="idhmhkcijbo">I don't have much hardware knowledge,
can't I just buy one?</A> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>Yes.  The two main players right now are Xybernaut (<A
HREF="http://www.xybernaut.com/">http://www.xybernaut.com/</A>) and
ViA (<A
HREF="http://www.flexipc.com/">http://www.flexipc.com/</A>).</DD>
