  <DD>Covert wearcomp/wearcam systems developed in the early 1990s
took an important first step toward making it possible to look normal
and be connected.  Currently the so-called "underwearable computer"
makes it possible to be wired without looking weird.</DD>

  <DD>The loud clicky switches of the 1970s and 1980s have given way
to much quieter soft-touch switches.  Modern one-handed keyboards can
be much quieter than the quietest of soft-touch laptop computer
keyboards.  Moreover, since you can hide your hand under the table or
in a pocket, the typing sounds are that much more diminished, as is
the distracting movement of the hand.</DD>

  <DD>It is interesting the manner in which the paranoia has increased
together with the reduction in size of the apparatus, and so what is
most notable, is that there has been a roughly constant level of
aggravation at the airport.  As the apparatus has gotten smaller, over
the years, so too has the paranoia level gotten higher.  Words like
"lead-acid" and "lithium ion" are frightening to them -- it's better
to call them "camcorder batteries" when they ask what kind of
batteries they are.  They'd like it to go in the cargo hold (e.g. as
checked luggage), or at least off-body (carry-on rather than wear-on).
If you wear it, expect to find yourself sometimes in a private search
area in your underwear, pulled back, or the like, and the nose of a
specially trained dog at the point of contact between your body and
the apparatus.  Sometimes one may be asked to shut down during takeoff
and landing.  One might half-expect "please turn off all pacemakers
during takeoff and landing".  It's been a lot better, working directly
with the FAA, on what's acceptable.  It kind-of ruins the experiment
if you've got to strip it off and lose data (e.g. if keeping a
year-long ECG, respiration, video, etc. record), but they're paranoid
about emissions during takeoff and landing.</DD>
