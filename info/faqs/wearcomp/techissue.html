  <DD>There are many good video camera viewfinders that can display 24
rows of 80 characters.  While many of the modern LCD viewfinders are
not capable of 80x24 text, there are a good many older black and white
viewfinders that can display a sharp and clear 80x24 screen, and many
can be had for $10 or less.  As a parts scavenger, just be on the
lookout for studio quality video cameras.</DD>

  <DT><a name="hcysadtctye">How can you see a display that close to your eye?</a> [MIT]</DT>
  <DD>Most HMDs appear to be farther away than they actually are.  For
example, when you look into the PE, you see the equivalent of a 15"
monitor at about two feet away.</DD>

  <DT><a name="hldtbliaw">How long do the batteries last in a wearable?</a> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>Batteries are generally swapped once, twice, or maybe three
times a day, depending on how much equipment is being used at any
given time.  Most computers run about eight hours on a single
charge.</DD>

  <DT><a name="wisrufi">Why isn't speech recognition used for input?</a> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>Early systems, in the 1970s, were voice controlled, but more
recently it has been found that voice control is unsuitable for most
occasions.  Besides the fact that people will think you're strange
when you talk to yourself, it is very impolite to speak while others
are speaking.  For example, in class, if you use it to take notes, you
would be disrupting others with your speech. You may not always merely
want a transcript (or recording) of what the instructor is saying, but
often you will want to record your own thoughts that may be triggered
by what the instructor has said.  For this, you would want a medium of
your own that can be used unobtrusively.</DD>

  <DT><a name="dtmwthd">Doesn't the movement wreck the hard drive?</a> [Mann]</DT>
  <DD>Many hard drives commonly used in laptop computers can withstand
100G operational shock.  It is common to go jogging while editing, and
sometimes to shoot documentary video while on horseback or riding a
mountain bike down the center of a railway line, bumping over every
railway tie, and capturing the experience on a hard drive.</DD>

  <DT><a name="wcrimawsfcu">What challenges remain in making a wearable suitable for constant use?</a></DT>
  <DD>It was said that the three tests of personal imaging would be:
    <OL>
      <LI>the casino test</LI>
      <LI>the sports test</LI>
      <LI>the swim test</LI>
    </OL>
    <P>The underwearable made it possible to shoot documentary videos
in gambling casinos, and it has been ruggedized to the point where it
can be used in some sports, but the swim test probably remains as the
most difficult of these three.</P></DD>
