<h1>$3LL0U7'S page</h1>

<p>Yeah, I'm a geek -- couldn't you tell by all the content. I mean, what self-respecting normal person would have a site without all those gaudy graphics?  So, as the most important part of my site, here are my computers.</p>

<h2>Kodo</h2>
<p>This is my pride and joy at the moment. A nice shiny iBook running OS X. Yeah, some of you people out there are like "Oh jeez, a Mac user who thinks he's a geek." But my response to that is, "Too bad that guy doesn't own a Mac."</p>

<p>Seriously, though, Mac OS X can only be matched by BeOS. And since they died, Apple's standing at the top of the OS heap. All these years thinking that the power of Unix is what kept it from having a usable, unified GUI, and Apple turns around and explains that the geeks just didn't want to let anyone else in on the game.</p>

<p>Because of this box, I've pretty much stopped logging in to my Linux box at the office, or any other box for that matter (except via SSH).</p>

<h2>Loki</h2>
<p>A 486/100&nbsp;MHz laptop.  Not much, but he chugs along with Linux. I run X when I have to, but I was raised a console-boy, so it's hard to convert me.</p>

<p>Well, for the time being, loki is dead. His little hard drive couldn't take it anymore and went kaput. I don't want to say that the end of the litter fellow, but I don't know if I have much use for a 486 anymore.</p>

<h2>XMLG</h2>
<p>A 366&nbsp;MHz Pentium&nbsp;II laptop. This is my most used box.
Travels with me between home and the office, and whereever else I may
be going. Not too much else to say about this baby. Serves me well, and
handles everything I throw at it. Hopefully, it'll be dual-boot soon,
with either <a href="http://www.be.com/">BeOS</a> or <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.</p>

<h2>Diesel</h2>
<p>This is my beast. It's a 1&nbsp;GHz Athlon Thunderbird. It has 256&nbsp;MB of PC133 RAM, and currently acts as my server for CVS, IMAP, DHCP, etc. There's a Matrox G450 inside, and a SoundBlaster Live!&trade;. Of course, I have no monitors on the thing, so the video card is currently going to waste, but that will be remedied in time.</p>

<!--
All of these bad boys run Linux.  Dual-booting is sacrelige in my
house, but I can run other OSes on an emulated x86 if I so please.
As long as I never have to reboot, everyone can live in harmony.

UPDATE: On my current lan, the machines have all been named after
characters from _The Thundercats_.  Those names appear in parenthesis.

DIESEL (lion-o)
------
under construction
Diesel (aka D13Z3L), is a monster box.  To begin with, it is a
dual Pentium II, 333MHz system.  After that, it has 256MB RAM and
18.2 gigs of storage.  The entire thing is SCSI, with a 32x CD-
ROM, CD-R, and DVD.  Toss in an SLS-120, Jaz and Zip drives, and
you've covered most removable formats.  Oh yeah, don't forget the
24GB tape drive.  I'm still looking for a video card, but it will
be at least 12MB with 3DFX.  To top it all off, my apartment has
a 10Mb connection to the Internet.  Ahh, I love life.

UNLEADED (lynx-o)
--------
under construction
Not quite the power of Diesel, this is a 486/133 box.  It is
special however, if only because it is a wearable system.  This
baby's form factor is on the level of _War and Peace_.  Sure, it
was a long book, but it's rather small for a computer.  Unleaded
has an eyepiece and a handheld keyboard, for persistent usage.

MUMM-RA (mumm-ra)
-----
This is an old box (hence the Thundercat's mummy label).  It's
only a 486/33.  I use it as a gateway/firewall for my apartment's
network.  It also does IP masqing for me.  There's not too much
else to say, since I took out everything that wasn't absolutely
necessary.  It's a workhorse.

EMERSON, LAKE, &amp; PALMER (wileykat, N/A, &amp; wileykit)
---------------------------
My three 286es.  They got their names because one of them is an
old Emerson machine.  If anyone can tell me if this company still
exists, please do.  Basically, I use these machines for
experimentation with DOS and 16-bit OSes, like ELKS (just like
Linux, only smaller).  Fun for the whole family.-->
