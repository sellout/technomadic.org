<h1>Do you have what it takes to be a programmer? (a self-test)</h1>

<h2>Level 0</h2>

<p>This level determines if you can be a programmer at all.  If you do
not meet these requirements, you shouldn't even attempt it.  Go be a
humanities major or something.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Are you lazy?</li>
    <li>Are you impatient?</li>
    <li>Are you hubristic? (look it up)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you answered "no" to any of these questions, you have failed.  The
"camel book" clearly states that these are the virtues required of a
programmer.  If you are confused, RTFM.  Thank you.</p>

<h2>Level 1</h2>

<p>Here, you will be judged on other aspects of your life that make you
a suitable programmer.  The questions herein are much less important
than the previous section, but they will allow you to see where you
fit on the food chain.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Do you prefer cats over dogs?</li>
    <li>Do you play a musical instrument?</li>
    <li>If (1), is it the guitar?</li>
    <li>Do you read Sci-Fi?</li>
    <li>If (3), is Heinlein your favorite author?</li>
    <li>Do you consider yourself a punster?</li>
</ol>

<p>Multiply the number of yes answers by 16.667.  The result is your
percentile score among programmers.  If it's above 80, consider yourself
approaching the level of the greats such as Torvalds and Raymond.
Above 40 places you in the masses of competent, but under-appreciated
programmers who do the bulk of the actual work.  Everyone else, you
are the reason Windows is still alive.  It's the programmers who would
die without an IDE.  Oh well, someone has to do it -- at least until
World Domination ;)</p>

<h2>Level 2</h2>

<p>This final section is a bit more free-form, it will help you decide
what exactly to do with your mad k-skillz.  The answers to these
questions will determine what platform and language you would do best
with.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Do you prefer DOS, Windows, Unix, or MacOS?</li>
    <li>Do you prefer C, C++, LisP, PERL, or VisualBASIC?</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, this section is underdeveloped.  More will come as I have time.
For now, just pick the platform and language you like . . . unless
it's VisualBASIC.  In that case, go back to the first section and
answer "no" to the question about hubris.  If you prefer VB, you
obviously have no pride -- although, on the plus side, you have an
overabundance of laziness.</p>
