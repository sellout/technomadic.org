<p>I'm big on ideas or something.  I'm always thinking of stuff to do.
Here are a few of them.  Some are coming to fruition.</p>

<h2>Object OS</h2>
<p>This was seeded by a friend.  An operating system without applications.
Each datatype has a handler, and the handlers are managed by, well,
managers.  Only one application is ever running, the "init"
process.</p>

<h2>Smart Appliances</h2>
<p>This ties in with both my wearable terminal and object OS ideas.
Each appliance has a PAN interface (merely touch it to connect).
When a connection is made, the wearable says, "Oh, we're dealing with
an oven (or car, or toaster), load the correct handler/manager to use
this device.</p>

<h2>Grant</h2>
<p>My newest idea is to get a government grant to do the research I'm
working on in wearable computing.  It's something I think is very
worthwhile, but without government funding, I have to spend too much
time earning money to be able to do anything overly productive.
Hopefully, this will turn out well.</p>

<h2>Wearable Terminal</h2>
<p>X-Terminals have recently been renamed "network computers".  This is
unfortunate in my opinion.  I have kept with tradition in naming this
device.  There has been a lot of development in "wearable computing"
as of late and I have found myself very interested.</p>

<p>Originally, I tried to max out the power of my wearable computer.  I 
quickly found that there was a price to be paid in battery life and
weight.  My solution was to go to the opposite extreme -- use the
wearable system merely as a terminal.  With the high-speed wireless
systems available today, networking is a fairly simple matter.  The
computer is basically an X-Terminal with a wireless ethernet connection.</p>

<h2>Neuron Keyboard</h2>
<p>Naming this is a pain in the ass -- since it's not really a keyboard,
but I don't know any other word to describe it.  I should have it built soon,
so you'll be able to read the patent.</p>
