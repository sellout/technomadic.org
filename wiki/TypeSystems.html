<h2>The common distinction</h2>

<p>
Most programmers are aware of two type systems, <span style="text-decoration: underline">static</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">dynamic</span>. This
distinction is important, however it's not complete. Sometimes these two
systems are called <span style="text-decoration: underline">strong</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">weak</span>, but these terms are also used to
describe other differences in type systems, as we'll soon see, so to avoid
confusion, they should be avoided when discussing static and dynamic type
systems.

</p>

<p>
The difference between these two systems is often claimed to be whether or not
you have to explicitly label your variables with a type, e.g. :int foo = 7;: in
C as opposed to just <code>foo </code> 7;= in Perl. While this is commonly the case, and
serves as a fairly useful visual clue, it is not a very accurate description.
In fact, we will look at statically typed languages that do not require
variables to be labeled with their type.

</p>

<p>
In a statically typed language, such as C, each variable is of a single type
over its entire lifespan. Dynamically typed languages do not have this
restriction. For example, in Perl (a dynamically typed language) you can write:

</p>

<pre class="example">
foo = 7;
foo = &quot;seven&quot;;
</pre>

<p>
with no problem. In a statically typed language you would need to store these
values in separate variables because one is an integer, and the other is a
string.

</p>

<p>
If this is the case, what is the benefit of statically typed languages that can
counter the development speed and flexibility of the dynamic approach? There
are two things, compile-time type checking and runtime speed. With a statically
typed language, the compiler can usually (we'll come to the exception in a bit)
determine if an assignment is legal. If it's not, an error will be thrown, and
it must be fixed before the program can be compiled. In the example above, if
you later passed :foo: to a function that expected an integer, you wouldn't
discover the error until you ran the program. And then possibly only because of
an odd result, rather than an error message.

</p>

<p>
Since the compiler can do all of the type mapping at compile-time, then, that
is less work it has to do at runtime, hopefully providing some speed
improvement.

</p>

<h2>Static typing and its loopholes</h2>

<p>
Static type systems can be further divided into <span style="text-decoration: underline">strong</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">weak</span> type
systems (the ambiguous terms mentioned above). Weak systems have loopholes,
strong ones do not.

</p>

<p>
What is a loophole? It's a way to get around the type system. In C, that's
:void*:, in Java it's casting in general. It's anything that prevents a
type-check from happening until run-time.

</p>

<p>
You might ask which languages <span style="text-decoration: underline">don't</span> have loopholes. To a lot of programmers
out there, casting seems necessary. However, plenty of languages get along
without casting. Eiffel is one of them. It is strongly typed, and (because of
the lack of shared libraries) can even allow covariant<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> parameters in
methods.

</p>

<p>
If languages can exist without these loopholes, why have loopholes at all?

</p>

<h2>Math strikes again</h2>

<p>
Strongly typed languages offer us another benefit. Since the system is closed
and loophole-free, the computer can do a bit more of the work for us. There is
a set of algorithms called <span style="text-decoration: underline">type inference algorithms</span>. This bit of magic means
that, just as in dynamic languages, we no longer have to use type labels on
variables. The compiler will look at the code and determine what all the types
have to be. Strong type systems that have this property are called <span style="text-decoration: underline">latent</span>,
those that don't are called <span style="text-decoration: underline">manifest</span>.

</p>

<h2>Have we just come full circle?</h2>

<p>
At this point we have to take another look at dynamically typed languages. Now
that we can offer that same outward appearance, what are the actual differences
between a latently typed language and a dynamically typed one?

</p>

<p>
Dynamically typed languages still offer more flexibility in the sense that a
variable's type can change over the course of a program. Even though you're not
specifying the type explicity, the compiler still gives it one specific type
for the duration of the program. Considering all the work the compiler is doing
now (not only to reduce runtime, but also to bring development time closer to
that of dynamically typed languages), it could have slowed down considerably.

</p>

<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>

<p>
If you look at the final possibilities, you see that there are only four type
systems actually available -- <span style="text-decoration: underline">dynamic</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">latent</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">manifest</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">weak</span>. The
last three imply <span style="text-decoration: underline">static</span>, and latent and manifest also imply <span style="text-decoration: underline">strong</span>. By
using these four labels, we can discuss them without confusion, and use them to
decide which qualities are most important for a given project.
