<h2>What's <em>live</em> about Live PA?</h2>

<p>
I've played in bands, and written music, and have recently become involved with
techno, and the phenomenon of "Live PA". For those who aren't familiar with the
idea, the "PA" stands for "Performance Art", and it's basically about
performing music live.

</p>

<p>
Live music! What an incredible idea! And to think, I thought I've been watching
bands play live for years.

</p>

<p>
Yeah, the idea's not new of course, but the problem is that most of the
traditional justifications I can think of for live performance (from the
audience's perspective) are gone. The "live" in live techno ranges from trivial
to non-existant.

</p>

<p>
A friend of mine said, "if you can't screw up, it's not live." That's a pretty
liberal definition, but even so, a large number of live performances don't even
meet that criteria. There are the Live PA guys who have a sequencer and just
fake it on stage. Much like the big pop acts these days. Sure, it'll make money,
but what does the audience get out of it?

</p>

<h3>Why is :live: important to the musician?</h3>

<p>
Before we get to how to please the audience with live music, we've got to
decide why we're performing live in the first place.

</p>

<h4>Making a living</h4>

<p>
Many artists, myself included, prefer to treat MP3s and CDs as marketing,
distributing them for free, or to cover expenses. To these artists it's the
concerts that provide them with a living.

</p>

<h4>Connecting to fans</h4>

<h4>The "rush" of performing</h4>

<h3>Why is :live: important to the audience?</h3>

<h4>It's the only way to hear the music</h4>

<p>
This argument hasn't held up since the record player hit households everywhere.
Just buy the album -- cheaper than a concert ticket, and reusable.

</p>

<h4>A more cohesive and flexible set for dancing</h4>

<p>
The DJs have killed

</p>

<h4>Watch a musician practice his craft</h4>

<p>
Almost any time you see a performer play a smaller venue, you'll see a small
crowd of people not dancing and standing around the performer. Sure, you'll
find the usual groupies and hangers-on looking for whatever second-hand
recognition they can get, but if you look closer, you'll see another group. The
other musicians checking out the guy's gear and his talent. Stealing tricks and
just appreciating what he's doing.

</p>

<h3>Caesar's Wife</h3>

<p>
The old saying goes, "no only must Ceasar's wife <em>be</em> virtuous, she must
<em>appear</em> virtuous." The same goes for performers. Not only must you be making
the techno live, you must also appear to be making it live. Showing up with a
laptop and mouse doesn't cut it. I can move my mouse around the screen too, and
it doesn't really impress anyone.

</p>

<p>
Laptops aren't anathema to Live PA, but the mouse is. Dump it. Get some good
MIDI controllers, and learn to use something like {Max
<a href="http://cycling74.com/products/max">http://cycling74.com/products/max</a>} or PD to make controllers handle what your
mouse used to. If people hear a sound when they see a key pressed, they think
you're making music. If they see a knob twist as the filter sweeps, they get it.
They don't get the little mouse motion at all.

</p>

<p>
Cameras help. Don't try to get wide angles -- the audience already sees that.
Zoom in tight on your hands, or the places where your hands spend most of the
time doing interesting things. One over your faders, for impressive transitions,
or one looking across your keyboard if you play a lot of synth lines. Give the
audience a close-up of the action.
