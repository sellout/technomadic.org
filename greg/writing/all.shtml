    <h1>All</h1>

    <pre class="poem">
Love is my hope
the more the better.
Unconditional
love for everyone.
Sometimes it hurts.
Fighting hard not to hate
those who do not return it.

I write this for the ones
who would despise me.
My giving has been returned
a hundredfold.
My friends know who they are.
The ones who have held me
when I collapsed alone.

I asked for no one
but yet they came.
Would they comfort me
if I hadn't cared for them?
I need not ask.
Friendly hugs for some
more than friendly encounters for others.

To each his own
breed of caring.
Mine brings me comfort.
