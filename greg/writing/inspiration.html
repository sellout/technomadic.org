    <h1>Inspiration</h1>

	<p>Spring 1995</p>

<pre class="poem">
Failure in my eyes,
heart, spirit gone.
Nothing to show for my wasted pain;
some as ever, only older.
Crushed beneath
a weight greater than my suffering strength can endure;
slowly pressing me to my knees.
	Raising my eyes to surrender,
	meeting your gaze.
	The weight taken from me?
	No only your strength added to mine.
	I must succeed – complete the impossible,
	if only to justify you
	giving me that strength.
I shun recognition for my actions,
knowing it should go to my beloved.
