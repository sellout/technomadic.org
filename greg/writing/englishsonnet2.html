    <h1>English Sonnet 2</h1>

<pre class="poem">
Never before have I looked in your eyes. I see
within them a soul so bright. But you cover your eyes
and weep. Your tears flow like a river to the sea.
I place my hand upon you and bid, “arise.”

You turn away at once, your fear betraying
the feelings you hide within. Fear not, for I
share your hopes and kneel beside you, praying
that you’ll hold me closely as you cry.

I know it can not always be this way for us.
We each have our loves and our lives that persist
long after we part. I know we have discussed
our departure, but what of when we kissed?

For two more years and many weeks, each day
I beg, promise only that you’ll let me stay.
