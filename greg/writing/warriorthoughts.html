    <h1>Warrior Thoughts</h1>

<pre class="poem">
Time and time again
I find myself alone.
Come, enter the darkness,
the room is empty.
Take the hand offered,
as it is,
to you.
Do not give your hope
to the ones who would destroy you.
It is your own.
	Keep your heart strong,
	your arms weak,
	and your mind open.
	Only then can you join
	the honored halls of honest men.
Take your life not too seriously,
take home your wounds for healing.
You have been given to the hounds,
for a feast in your name is now.
Devoured by your hate,
stripped of your love,
the battle is called by indifference.
	Close your eyes,
	see everything clearer than ever in day.
	Disparity is gone to sleep.
	Cover your body with the dirt that will
	one day hold you closer than your mother.
	Feel cold rain pulling the death-love from your hand.
	Open your eyes and the fear is of yourself.
</pre>
