	<h1>A World without Reason</h1>

	<p>Apparently, I ask “why?” a lot. Apparently, that means “you’re wrong!” in some dialect of English that I’m unfamiliar with.</p>
	<p>When I ask “why?”, I’m not disagreeing. I’m just trying to determine the reasons for doing so, and if they apply to the current situation. However, the response is usually either, “because you’re supposed to,” or just anger at the apparent disagreement.</p>

	<h2>Societal Religion</h2>

	<p>When the reason behind something is not passed on, you are left with only the rote rule – often passed from person to person quite rapidly. The origin of the rule gone, it becomes dogma – absolutely true, regardless of context. Thus is created our societal religion, the set of these dogmatic rules that are accepted without question on a daily basis.</p>
	<p>These rules range from simple questions of typographic style to the societal laws that govern us. A law, for example, is created to solve or mitigate something that is seen as a problem. When there is a law preventing people from driving faster than 55&nbsp;mph, it doesn’t exist <em>because</em> people drive faster than that. It exists because when people drive faster than that, accidents are more likely to occur.</p>
	<p>When the connection between the rule and its reasons is lost, it passes into religion. Such a rule is just absolutely right. Our ability to question it is lost. Sometimes there is a legitimate reason that has just failed to be passed along. Other times, the reasons are hidden on purpose because people would not find them to their liking. And still other times, there really is no reason; someone perhaps thought it would be a good idea and told others, or an idea is borrowed from another field of study or situation that is not actually applicable in the new context.</p>

	<h2>Specific things I'm trying to find a reason for</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Why should I avoid first-person references in a résumé summary? And how should it be done so that it isn’t just a bunch of sentence fragments?</dt>
		<dd><p>As near as I can tell, this seems to be carried over from the field of formal writing. Using the first person, such as “I think …” is seen as less authortative than something along the lines of, “The evidence seems to indicate …”. In those cases, such an avoidance of the first-person is quite simple and it puts the focus on the subject and methods rather than the person performing the study.</p>
		<p>However, in a résumé the subject <em>is</em> that first person. Avoiding first-person references results in either awkward use of the third person, or sentence fragments. I can understand not wanting to pepper the summary with “I” everywhere, but that doesn't mean you have to avoid the first person.</p></dd>
