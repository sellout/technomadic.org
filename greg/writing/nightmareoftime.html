    <h1>Nightmare of time</h1>

<pre class="poem">
There’s a movement in the corner of your eye
you turn around, hit the ground
You’re lost in a movement of dreams
	There’s a girl you are kissing in the night
	you don’t see it, but you feel it
	And you can’t wake up!
It’s the dream of your life, a horrible twist
moving away, passing through
Don’t you know it’s only you…alone
	The years are flying by your face
	you can only dodge them for so long
	Before you go where you belong in the end
Do you see any way out of this movement of the moments
this quickly ending thread of life
If you do then tell me…please
</pre>
