    <h1>Maybe a cry</h1>

<pre class="poem">
There’s a cry in the darkness of my mind.
I’ve heard it before.
I think it’s the sound of the passing of time;
or maybe it’s not.
	The more I ignore it, the louder it gets.
	A cry of pain?
	Of this endless pain I feel, surrounded by death;
	or maybe it’s not.
Is it maybe the cry of confidence invaded by doubt?
A scream of anguish?
Or maybe just the imaginings of my tortured conscience;
or maybe not.
