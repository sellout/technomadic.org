    <h1>Winds of change</h1>

<pre class="poem">
a single tree is standing
the only to survive the violent storm
a radical among the stubborn norm
a flexible bough and a strong root
the winds of change are blowing
with only a select few left to prosper
	but soon the supple aspen and willows
	will give way to a new status quo
	the time will soon come again
	when the wind will be needed to knock the conditioned down
	the time for the winds of change is coming soon
</pre>
