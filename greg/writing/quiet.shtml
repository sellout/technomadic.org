    <h1>Quiet Hours</h1>

<pre class="poem">
Mmm, so warm, so close;
just out of reach.
I yearn for any moment when I can feel your cheek against mine.
No one knows.
A taboo subject, held between us.
To see you, bliss;
to touch you, ecstasy.
No one allowed into the circle.
Only you and I will know
the thoughts that pass in these quiet hours.
</pre>
