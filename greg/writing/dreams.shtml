    <h1>Dreams</h1>

<pre class="poem">
Close your eyes.
Do you see what I've been telling you?
Nothing is beyond your reach.
You need only to relax
and open your mind to the possibilities.
I promise you everything,
but you will have much more than that.
You have the will, the desire to pursue what you want.
I would give everything if only to gain desire.
The one I crave is that which can not be gained.
You have the drive I want,
so please,
use it,
become your dreams;
satisfy mine.
</pre>
