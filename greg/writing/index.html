    <h1>Diesel fumes result in writings like these.</h1>

    <p>Yes, this is pretty damn boring right now, but give me some time to collect my writings and type them into the machine and we'll have a nice page devoted to my favorite author – or at least someone I’m willing to read – me. Thanks. Right now, the only thing you can see here is my <A HREF="journal.shtml">journal</A> and some <A HREF="#poetry">poetry</A>. I also have a rather racy essay that should be here soon. Other than that, I'm not promising anything.</p>

    <p>Oh, yeah, there is this <A HREF="beach.shtml">romance story</A> that I wrote. I think romances are a bunch of horribly written crap, but a lot of people seemed to like this, so I figure I'll let you decide for yourself.</p>

    <p>I'm a big fan of phonetics and grammar. I mean, <em>Pygmalion</em> is one of my favorite books (the musical <em>My Fair Lady</em> is based on it). Anyway, here are some of my favorite dictionaries on the Net, mostly humourous if you know the context.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><a href="http://falcon.jmu.edu/~prochakt/b'tay.shtml">The B’tayctionary</a></dt>
		<dd>as specialized as they get. This covers the speech patterns of about six people who live together (me included). If you can master this, you too can be an honorary B’tay.</dd>

		<dt><a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/">The New Hacker’s Dictionary</a></dt>
		<dd>oh, a classic. Also known as <em>the jargon file</em>, this baby contains everything you could want to know about the peculiarities of speech that propagate through Usenet and other hack-oriented circles. It’ll help anyone understand us, I promise.</dd>

    <h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>

    <P>I had all my poetry in a nice long HTML page, but somewhere along the way of about four formats on my machine, they got lost. Now, I have to find the sole printed copy and put them all back into the machine. Don't hold your breath on this one.</P>

    <P>OK, fine, stop badgering me. Here are some poems that should hold you over for about five minutes. They are actually some of my least favorites, but I did write them, so there.</P>

<h2 id="essays">Essays/Reports</h2>

<p>Right now here are a few things I wrote for a religion class.  I haven't had much interest in writing for class, but this one was a hell of a lot better, so my essays are actually rather decent.</p>
