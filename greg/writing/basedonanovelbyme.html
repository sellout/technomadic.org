    <h1>Based on a novel by me</h1>

<pre class="poem">
“Quiet, damn you!”
The voices just won’t stop
telling me stories in my head.
He goes to die alone
without me.
Help this man that stands
with no support below him,
holding only his head up high.
Close your mind forever;
in life your death becomes love.
Love is hope.

Man will die first.

No, I don’t believe that.
In the beginning?!
Before there was anything, there was ME!
Thank you.
