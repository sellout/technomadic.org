    <h1>Smell your fear</h1>

<pre class="poem">
			Can anyone sense my fear?
		The stench is suffocating me,
	the smell of cowardice.
A bitter-sweet taste on my lips,
warmth on my tongue,
	but not enough – cold shock in the nerves of my teeth.
A chill, shaking my muscles, loosening my resolve,
runs down my back.
No courage – unable to face my fears.
What is your cowardice?
What are your fears?
Or is your worst fear
fear of having fear.
	Admitting nothing, you wallow,
afraid someone will discover your fears.
But what is there to fear?
“All we have to fear is fear itself”
Maybe that is all you fear –
the possibility that there is something you fear.
			I am stronger than you,
		my fears have been conquered.
	Facing everything at once, crushing
“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”
What are you afraid of?
