I am an energetic and enthusiastic software engineer who can provide the quality
implied by the title of engineer. I am knowledgeable about programming language
design, and am capable of working in any language at an intermediate level
within a week of being introduced to it. I have no interest in any sort of
managerial position -- only in taking my craft as far as possible. I am
determined, and take great pride in my work. I am a strong and flexible part of
any team, willing to take on less glamorous work to make sure the end result is
as good as possible.
