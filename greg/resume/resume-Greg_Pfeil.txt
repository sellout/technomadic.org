Energetic, enthusiastic, and capable of providing the quality implied by the
title of engineer, I am knowledgeable in language design and able to utilize any
language at an intermediate level in a week's time. The craft of software is of
utmost importance - creating applications worthy of pride. I am determined and
take great pleasure in my work - a strong and flexible part of any team, willing
to take on less glamorous work to make sure the end result is of the highest
possible quality.
