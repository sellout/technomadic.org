<h2>Experienced Software Engineer</h2>

<p>I am an energetic and enthusiastic software engineer who can provide the
quality implied by the title of <em>engineer</em>. I am knowledgeable about
programming language design, and am capable of working in any language at an
intermediate level within a week of being introduced to it. I have no interest
in any sort of managerial position – only in taking my craft as far as
possible. I am determined, and take great pride in my work. I am a strong and
flexible part of any team, willing to take on less glamorous work to make sure
the end result is as good as possible.</p>
