     <h1>Stuff I Want</h1>

<p>So, recently, with my birthday coming up and all (May 26), people have been asking me what I want. My general response is someone along the lines of “Well, gee, I don’t know….” So, I’m putting this list up here so I can just point people at it and I can just add and remove things as I go.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>Now, you don’t <em>have</em> to get me something that’s on the list. If you’re going to stray, here are a few general guidelines.</p>

<ol>
	<li>If it’s not useful, I won’t like it. I try to keep my possessions fairly minimal, so this is important.</li>
	<li>Unless you’re someone I converse with regularly about computers or music, don’t even think about getting me something related to either of those areas.</li>
	<li>If you don’t know what to get me, the list is going to help you more than the clerk at the local gift shop.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The List</h2>

<p>These are all listed in order of my desire. Don’t feel the need to just pick the first one in your price range, though – if there’s something on the list that seems attuned to our particular relationship or that makes you think “I really enjoyed this, I should share that experience with Greg”, I’ll appreciate the relevance and be more likely to remember who got it for me.</p>
