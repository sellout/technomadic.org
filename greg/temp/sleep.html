      'DaVinci Sleep', or just nuts?

    <P>
      I don't know if Leonardo DaVinci actually used anything like this sleep pattern, but both <CITE>Seinfeld</CITE> and <CITE>TV Guide</CITE> told me he did, so it must be true.  My hope is to be able to completely ignore the normal 24 hour day cycle an





d apply this unique sleep pattern to my everyday life.  Of course, this whole idea is based solely on the fact that I once had a psychology teacher who mentioned that the human body was not meant to work on a 24 hour cycle.

    <P>
      I plan to work on a 26 hour day.  This means that the cycle will repeat itself every other week.  Within that 'day', I plan to have six sleep cycles (SC).  Each SC will consist of being awake for 3:50 and sleeping for 0:30.  This comes out to a tota





l of 3 hours of sleep for each 'day'.  When taken to a solar day (24 hours), I will be getting approximately 2.76 hours of sleep per day.  Many people will say that this is not enough to keep yourself running.
    </P>

    <P>
      I feel that keeping good eating habits as well as setting a regimented excercise schedule will allow me to continue this schedule and eventually adapt to it so that I have more energy while on it than I do currently.  If I continue to follow this sc





hedule I think my body will recognize the pattern and eventually I will become tired during the sleep part of my schedule and alert during the awake part.  I think this is how sleep has always worked, but people generally do not keep themselves on a stric





t enough schedule for their bodies to find the pattern and therefore they become lethargic.
    </P>

    <P>
      Certain activites must be set up within the schedule so as not to lose the regularity which had been previously set by the sun.  I will eat a small meal directly before each sleep cycle (six meals a day), showers come after the first sleep cycle and





 oral hygene after the second and fifth sleep cycles.  I will also set up an excercise regimen which will be posted here when it is complete.  Unfortunately, I can not schedule classes to fit within the schedule, but I hope to balance my excercise and pra





ctice time (I am a guitarist) as well as homework, so the load falls pretty evenly throughout the day.  This means that thwe bulk of my non-class activities will take place during the night.  My bi-weekly structural schedule is also on-line with a compact





 <A HREF="schedulegif.html">graphic version</A>, and a faster, but more awkward <A HREF="schedule.html">text version</A>.  Hopefully, I will document each day in a six column table with each column representing one sleep cycle.
