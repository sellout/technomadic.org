This is essentially a casual resume, my real <a href=resume.html>resume</a> is here (text only).<p>

Before I get into the boring list of facts and activities, I'll explain myself, my goals and aspirations.  I want to write operas in Iceland.  A simple goal, it requires a flight and a stack of manuscript paper.  Unfortunately, there's this whole mess about needing to earn a living.  I don't want to get stuck in some low-end job like so many composition and performance majors do, I want to do what I enjoy.  As you can see from this and the rest of my 10.7 megs of web space, I enjoy computers.  Currently I am willing to <b>create web pages and compose music for whoever wants it</b>.  I need to build up a larger portfolio and I have to see what people do and don't like.  I want to work at home, so composing and computer programming are two good fields for that.  Anyway, operas are the highest form of music, and Iceland is the happiest country on Earth, what more could anyone want?
