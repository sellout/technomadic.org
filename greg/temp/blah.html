      Why does this site look blah?
    </H1>

    <P>
      Well, this site may not look blah to you, but it currently looks blah to the majority of people browsing the Internet.  The reason for this is a new version of <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">HTML</A>.  HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" and it is the computer language used to design all of the wonderful (and not so wonderful) sites you see on the Web.
    </P>

      The fourth version of HTML is still in the experimental stages, but a major decision has been made in its development.  Prior to this version, each release has built on the previous one, making sites look great on the newest browsers, while still being attractive on older ones.  With HTML 4.0, this has changed.  In order to create more consistant sites while, at the same time, separating the appearance and content of the Web more clearly, HTML has been completely redesigned.  This is good in the long run, but for people currently using graphical browsers such as Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator and Mosaic, there will be a noticable decline in the quality of web sites until new browsers are available.
    </P>

    <P>
      HTML has been stripped of its presentational tags, such as <CODE>&#60;FONT&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;CENTER&#62;</CODE>.  This must be compensated for by using some other method to gain the same results.  In order to make this happen, there has been the creation of some additional languages that will be used to improve the appearance of the Web.  <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Style/">CSS</A> and <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Style/">DSSSL</A> are two of these languages.  They stand for "Cascading Style Sheets" and "Document Style Semantics and
Specification Language" respectively.  These two standards, once implemented will make the Web more attractive (while also taking less time to download).
    </P>

    <P>
      CSS consists of creating a separate file which holds all of the information for the appearance of the site.  The colors, the positioning of certain elements and the fonts will all be controlled by this CSS document.  Each page on the site references back to this document to define its appearance.  This makes a site more consistant by giving each page the same general layout,  and also makes it easier to update and change because a single change will affect the entire site, without having to modify each individual page.
    </P>

    <P>
      DSSSL is very similar to CSS in effect, but it is much more powerful and complicated.  These two languages, along with the other new extensions to HTML, will bring the Web to a new level.
    </P>

    <P>
      Of course, any browser that completely supports HTML 4.0 can be downloaded from this page, but unfortunately, there aren't any yet.  The newest versions of Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer both support CSS to some extent, but neither do it very well yet.  Both of those browsers can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.browsers.com">Browsers.com</A>.  Just remember, neither browser is in its final version yet, these are still in the testing stages.
