		<h1>Characters</h1>
		<p>The characters to be mapped to the keys are categorized in order to to give some sense of priority when it comes to positioning them on the keyboard. Below is a summary of the categories and the characters contained in each. Please check the respective pages for more detailed information.</p>

		<p>Initially, most of the information on this page comes from recommendations of Robert Bringhurst in his book <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>.</p>

		<h2>First-Class Characters</h2>
		<p>The first-class characters are all the characters deemed necessary to produce all of the listed languages. This includes all the required letters, numerals, and diacriticals, plus a decent set of punctuation. All first-class characters <em>must</em> require only a single keystroke.</p>
		<p>Aside from the standard letters and numerals on a qwerty keyboard, the following characters are also <em>first-class</em>: þ, Þ, ß, ð, Ð, µ, æ, Æ, œ, Œ, ı, ȝ, Ȝ, ¡, £, $, €, %, °, &amp;, ª, º, *, (, ), †, ‡, -, −, –, —, ×, ÷, =, ¶, [, ], §, :, ;, “, ”, ‘, ’, «, », ‹, ›, ,, ., ·, ¿, /, …, •, ¤, +</p>
		<p>As are the following diacritics: ˝, ´, `, slashthrough, ˚, ¨, ˆ, ˜, ¸, ˇ, ˘, ¯, ˛, ˙, dotunder, linethrough, hook, horn, hoi, underscore</p>

		<h2>Second-Class Characters</h2>
		<p>The second-class characters are useful for typography and as punctuation, however, they are not as necessary as the first-class characters. This distinction has two consequences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The second-class characters <em>may</em> require more than one keystroke;</li>
			<li>and their position on the keyboard is secondary to that of the first-class characters.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The second-class characters are: ə, <span class="diacritical">viniculum</span>, ′, |, ¬, 〈, 〉, &gt;, &lt;, ^, ~, {, }, „, ∥, ldbracket, rdbracket, ♮, ♭, ≠, ±, #, ♯, ‰, ☞, ❧, ©, ƒ, ®, ™, ¥</p>

		<h2>Additional Characters</h2>
		<p>Additional characters are typographic and mathematic characters that we can use to fill the remaining spaces on the keyboard. This allows us to maximize the characters possible via combination.</p>

		<h2>Legacy Characters</h2>
		<p>The legacy characters are the ASCII characters that aren’t needed in a modern system, but must be kept around because of their use as control characters, in programming languages, and for familiarity.</p>
		<p>The legacy characters are: -&#160;(replace with hyphen and subtraction), _, `, \, ", '&#160;(replace with prime), ^&#160;(replace with logical and).</p>
