<p>Ok, ok, I did it -- I broke down and made some themes and other things of a
GUI nature.  Yes, chastize me, poke fun.  I can handle it.  I do what I have
to.  Well, since you're

<h3>nqBe</h3>

<p>This is more of a project than a theme.  Right now, I have an Enlightenment
theme, an xdm skin, some Xdefaults settings, and a gkrellm skin.  I want to
have a fairly consistent desktop, and I want to learn how themeing in a bunch
of different systems works, so I'm messing with it here.  I also want to do a
QT theme, a GTK theme, maybe some other window managers, etc.  Right now, you
can get the Enlightenment theme from <a
href="http://e.themes.org/themes.phtml?themeid=955570845">e.themes.org</a>.
The rest will be made available soon . . .</p>

<h3>GoodUI</h3>

<p>Umm, I have a "<a href="./GoodUI.shtml">screenshot</a>" of this one.  To
actually implement it will require more than just some themeing.</p>
